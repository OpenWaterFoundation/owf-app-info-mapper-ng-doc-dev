* [InfoMapper download website](http://software.openwaterfoundation.org/infomapper/)

**The InfoMapper software is under development as an open source software project at the Open Water Foundation.
Although significant progress has been made, it is expected that significant changes will occur in the
near future as new features are added.**

This documentation is intended for InfoMapper developers that have (or would like to acquire) experience with Angular,
GeoProcessor, and TSTool software.
The Open Water Foundation uses Visual Studio Code as the development tool,
although other tools can be used.

The primary development environment is currently Windows 10.
The primary deployment environment is Amazon web services.

## About the Open Water Foundation ##

The [Open Water Foundation](http://openwaterfoundation.org) is a nonprofit social enterprise that focuses

OWF also works to advance open data tools.
The InfoMapper, which focuses on publishing information products,
